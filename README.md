# The-Rust-Data-Structure-Handbook
My code for completing the book titled "The Rust Data Structure Handbook: Theoretical Insights and Practical Techniques for Mastery" by Amir Keivan Shafiei. Which is currently on sale at Amazon: https://a.co/d/fxrlMYJ

# Note: As of April 5th, 2025, after getting to the first exercise section of this book. I have decided to discontinue using this book to study data structures and algorithms in Rust for the following reasons:

* No Solutions within the book. (This requires me to use an LLM AI service in order to generate the most optimal solutions to the exercises.)

* The basis of the theoretical explanations of algorithms in this book has not been taught to me, as part of my previous university education. (This would require me to learn the mathematical basis of the logical explanations in the book. Which I am sure would necessitate additional led weeks before I am able to practice implementing the algorithms in a practical manner.)

* No corresponding GitHub repository for the lessons and exercises in this book. (This requires me to use a LLM AI in order to generate unit tests.)
